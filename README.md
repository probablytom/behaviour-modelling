# Behaviour Modelling

This project sets out to model the behaviour of a sociotechnical system under stress, my 4th year dissertation project. 
Many things are to be worked out at the moment, including the content of this README. 
In the meantime, all work is done on relevant branches. I'll get this cleaned up real soon.
